# AI CALCULATOR PROJECT

A Calculator that uses Google's AI SDK and the DOTENV lib to create a fully functioning AI calculator that takes two numbers and multiplies them together.

## What I learned:

* How to Connect the Google SDK to python
* How to secure my API key
* Further enhanced my understanding of classes
